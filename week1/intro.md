## Note on LLMs and use of AI

LLMs and similar AI tools have grown exponentially in popularity over the last few years.

Though frowned upon by some, their use is by no means completely discouraged.

Examples of acceptable uses of LLMs:

* Asking ChatGPT how an argument for a particular R function works (e.g. what does `fml` mean in `lm(fml = y ~ x, data = df)`?)

* Finding extra context for functions/code snippets you're not sure you
understand and want some clarification

These are okay! Often times you'll get a much better answer than spending hours browsing stackoverflow threads.

Examples of unacceptable uses of LLMs:

* Generating partial or entire solutions for questions (e.g. asking for code which creates a plot required to answer a particular question on a problem set)

* Copy pasting problem set questions verbatim into an LLM chatbot

These are not fine. Not only are you *not* going to be learning anything, but you'll also have a rough time on the midterm and final!
